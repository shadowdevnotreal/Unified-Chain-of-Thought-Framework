# CoT Command Quick Reference
## One-Page Guide to Chain of Thought Cognitive System

---

## The Master Command

```
cot [intensity] [your task]
```

---

## Intensity Levels

| Command | Thinking Power | Best For | Time |
|---------|---------------|----------|------|
| `cot` | 4K tokens | Daily tasks, debugging, analysis | 5-15s |
| `cot+` | 10K tokens | Complex problems, architecture, refactoring | 20-45s |
| `cot++` | 32K tokens | Critical challenges, deep analysis, system design | 45-180s |

---

## Quick Examples

### Standard Intensity
```
cot review this code for bugs

cot explain how this algorithm works

cot analyze these performance metrics
```

### Enhanced Intensity  
```
cot+ refactor this component architecture

cot+ design a scalable database schema

cot+ debug this intermittent race condition
```

### Maximum Intensity
```
cot++ architect a distributed microservices system

cot++ solve this production-critical performance issue

cot++ redesign our entire authentication flow
```

## Natural Language Alternatives

**Standard:**
- "think about this"
- "analyze"

**Enhanced:**
- "think deeply"
- "megathink"  
- "think hard"

**Maximum:**
- "ultrathink"
- "think really hard"
- "think intensely"

---

## The 4-Phase Process (Automatic)

Every `cot` command executes:

1. **LISTEN** → Understand completely
2. **THINK** → Break down step-by-step
3. **REASON** → Validate logic
4. **RESPOND** → Deliver clearly

---

## Decision Tree: Which Intensity?

```
Simple task? 
  ↓ YES → cot
  ↓ NO
  ↓
Multiple components?
  ↓ YES → cot+
  ↓ NO → cot
  ↓
Mission critical?
  ↓ YES → cot++
  ↓ NO → cot+
```

## Pro Tips

✓ **Start simple:** Use standard `cot` first, escalate if needed

✓ **Add context:** Load files first with `/read` for better results

✓ **Be specific:** Clear task descriptions = better outputs

✓ **Check reasoning:** Review the thinking process shown

✓ **Iterate smartly:** Refine based on what you learn

---

## Common Mistakes

✗ Stacking keywords: `cot++ megathink ultrathink` → Just use `cot++`

✗ Vague requests: `cot help` → Be specific about what you need

✗ Wrong intensity: Using `cot++` for simple syntax checks → Wasteful

✗ No context: Asking without providing relevant information

---

## Progressive Escalation Pattern

```
1. Try: cot analyze this problem
   ↓
2. If insufficient: cot+ think deeply about this
   ↓  
3. If still stuck: cot++ ultrathink this challenge
```

---

## What You Get

Every `cot` response includes:

1. **Understanding confirmation** → "I understand you need..."
2. **Step-by-step reasoning** → Transparent thought process  
3. **Logic validation** → Consistency checks
4. **Confidence level** → How certain is this answer?
5. **Alternatives considered** → What else was evaluated?
6. **Next steps** → What to do with this info

---

## Emergency Protocol

**When facing critical pressure:**

```
cot++ URGENT

Context: [complete situation]
Constraints: [limits]
Stakes: [what's at risk]

Need: validated reasoning + risk assessment + decision
```

---

## Remember

- **Quality > Speed:** Thorough beats fast
- **Show reasoning:** Never hide the thinking
- **Stay humble:** Acknowledge uncertainty
- **Validate always:** Check the logic
- **Escalate wisely:** Match power to problem

---

## Quick Start Command

**Try this right now:**

```
cot analyze my current task and suggest the optimal approach
```

---

## Mastery Indicator

You know you've mastered the system when:
- You instinctively choose the right intensity
- You can explain your reasoning process clearly
- You catch logical errors before they become problems
- You make better decisions faster
- You trust the process completely

**Print this. Post it. Reference it daily.**

*One command. Four phases. Better thinking.*
